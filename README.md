## Questions ##
Certainly! Here are 15 TypeScript coding questions with increasing difficulty:

1. **Level 1 - Basic Functions:**
   Write a TypeScript function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

2. **Level 2 - Array Operations:**
   Write a TypeScript function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the sum of all the numbers.

3. **Level 3 - Object Manipulation:**
   Define a TypeScript interface `Person` with properties `name` and `age`. Then write a function that takes a `Person` object as a parameter and prints out their name and age.

4. **Level 4 - Basic Classes:**
   Create a TypeScript class `Rectangle` with properties `width` and `height`, and a method `calculateArea` that returns the area of the rectangle. Then create an instance of the `Rectangle` class and print its area.

5. **Level 5 - Generics and Type Safety:**
   Write a TypeScript function that takes an array of any type and returns the first element of the array. Use generics to ensure type safety.

6. **Level 6 - String Manipulation:**
   Write a TypeScript function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

7. **Level 7 - Array Sorting:**
   Write a TypeScript function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array with the numbers sorted in ascending order.

8. **Level 8 - Object Sorting:**
   Write a TypeScript function that takes an array of objects with a `name` property and sorts them alphabetically by name.

9. **Level 9 - Advanced Classes:**
   Create a TypeScript class `Circle` with a property `radius` and methods `calculateArea` and `calculateCircumference`. Then create an instance of the `Circle` class and print its area and circumference.

10. **Level 10 - Advanced Generics:**
    Write a TypeScript function that takes an array of objects and a key, and returns a new array with the values of that key from each object.

11. **Level 11 - Recursive Functions:**
    Write a TypeScript function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

12. **Level 12 - Algorithmic Problems:**
    Write a TypeScript function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

13. **Level 13 - Sorting Algorithms:**
    Write a TypeScript function that implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of numbers.

14. **Level 14 - Searching Algorithms:**
    Write a TypeScript function that implements the binary search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array of numbers.

15. **Level 15 - Advanced Data Structures:**
    Implement a TypeScript class for a singly linked list with methods for insertion, deletion, and searching.

These questions cover a wide range of TypeScript concepts and gradually increase in complexity. Feel free to tackle them and let me know if you need any guidance or assistance!
